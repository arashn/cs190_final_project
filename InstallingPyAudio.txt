First, install PortAudio:
sudo apt-get install libasound-dev

Then build PortAudio:
./configure && make

Then install .so files to use in projects:
sudo make install

Projects built this way will expect PortAudio to be installed on target systems in order to run. If you want to build a more self-contained binary, you may use the libportaudio.a file:
cp lib/.libs/libportaudio.a /PATH/TO/OUR/PROJECT

On some systems you may need to use:
cp /usr/local/lib/libportaudio.a /PATH/TO/OUR/PROJECT

(NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART! OS X DIDNâ€™T REQUIRE IT)
You may also need to copy portaudio.h, located in the include/ directory of PortAudio into your project. Note that you will usually need to link with the approriate libraries that you used, such as ALSA and JACK, as well as with librt and libpthread. For example:
gcc main.c libportaudio.a -lrt -lm -lasound -ljack -pthread -o YOUR_BINARY

Finally, install PyAudio:
sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio

If the latest version of PyAudio is not available, install it using pip:
pip install pyaudio
